# Heights---Array-and-For-Loops
Initialize project Heights - Array and For loops

This program uses an Array to insert primitive data with a for loop with 
the user and then for loop thru the array to print the data and find the
average value.

This program asks the user for the heights of each student in the 
classroom. Then finds the height of the tallest student, and the average
height of all students.
